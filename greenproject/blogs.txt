Why Tree is Very Important?

The canopies of trees act as a physical filter, trapping dust and 
absorbing pollutants from the air. Each individual tree removes up
to 1.7 kilos every year. They also provide shade from solar 
radiation and reduce noise. Over 20 species of British trees and
shrubs are known to have medicinal properties. The oil from birch 
bark, for example, has antiseptic properties. Research shows that 
within minutes of being surrounded by trees and green space, your 
blood pressure drops, your heart rate slows and your stress levels come down.
